    <h2>My Favourite Scene in Shawshank Redemption</h2>

            Shawshank Redemption is an exceptional movie, with 
plenty of endearing moments.  
The silent, <code>picturesque</code> shores of Zihuatanejo 
(surprising memorable for a place with no memory) 
as the audience gets closure that Red does indeed meet 
his old friend. Who can forget Brooks' letter, his tale of institutionalization, 
and of punishment rather than rehabilitation. Par for the course, I have to
mention the iconic, carthartic rain scene that is thematic to the entire movie.

Out of all these great moments, my favourite scene 
in Shawshank Redemption is when Andy plays music 
through the intercom for his fellow inmates. This 
scene was impressionable 
because it touched on something I have recently been mulling 
over: my modus operandi. Thus far, my decision
making has been largely been based on "utility", or as a short-cut,
convenience. This was the result of post-modern attitudes toward
morality; I deconstructed morality but never reconstructed it.
After all, why should I inconvenience myself for something that 
I cannot even rigorously define?

          A quote which perfectly encapsulates my 
enthusiasm for the scene:
        </p>
    <blockquote>
      A man when wrong apologizes, when right endures the consequences.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Outside the context of Shawshank Redemption, the "right" here could be
interpreted as "correct", like Galelio and his Heliocentric model.
However, I interpret the right as a moral right. 
The quote (and Andy) reminds us that some acts are worth
performing, even in the face of the consequences. For his stunt, 
Andy was placed in solitary for a week; this stunt would have
never rejected by my utilitarian calculations. However, it was the 
right thing to do, as Red reflects,

    <blockquote>
To this day, I have no idea what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don’t want to know. Some things are left best unsaid. I would like to think they were singing about something was so beautiful it can’t be expressed in words and make your heart ache because of it. I tell you those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a Gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away. For the briefest moment every last man in Shawshank felt free.

Then again, what is more right than showing these hope deprived men that there is more
to life than these thick concrete walls, to the extent that the sick raise from their beds; 
that there is beauty in the world, and that in their minds, they are free.
