<p>I've been getting swept up by the Zone 2 cardio trend recently. I didn't even
look in depth on what the benefits are for my body, but I know that cardio is
good, and I haven't done it consistently since the lockdown. Plus, 30-45
minutes of light jogging (enough hold a conversation) was not daunting. I
decided to do 30 minutes of cardio on hypertrophy training days, and 2
additional days a week where I do an hour of cardio.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did 30 minutes without a hitch.</p>
<p>Today, I started my session with a sense of ease; my body didn't feel tired
after yesterday's session. 30 minutes went by relatively quickly, but it sunk
in that I'm only half-way there. <span style="color:var(--m);">{30 minutes should be good, you just started
cardio again!}</span> The clock increments at a snail's pace. I consider turning on
the TV in front of me, but I am reminded of a chemical burn; I am Jack's
inflated sense of pride. I start employing strategies to stop obsessing about
time. <span style="color:var(--m);">{45 minutes! Isn't that enough?}</span> One of them is to absent-mindedly stare
at a socket in the wall. Another is to start focusing on my breath, and slow
it down. <span style="color:var(--m);">{Your shoe lace is untied}</span> Eventually I start counting my breaths, and
look at the clock after every 60 breaths. <span style="color:var(--m);">{Wow your right knee feels funny huh?}</span>
I look at the people around me, clueless about the war unfolding before them.
<span style="color:var(--m);">{Do you feel that blister on your foot?}</span></p>
<p>The last minute wasn't easy. My legs feel numb. The clock doesn't tick fast enough.
I have no energy to celebrate. But I acknowledge my small triumph. I think 
about how I'd be doing this again tomorrow.</p>
