<p>I used to think time spent doing chores was waste time; time when I wasn't
doing something productive. As a result, I would cram music, youtube videos, 
and other auditory or visual media in parallel.</p>
<p>Now I've realized that every chore is an opportunity to meditate. To hone in
on a singular activity, and embrace "boredom"; to "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788510/characters/nm0724656">extract simple pleasure
from the execution of a task well done</a>".</p>
