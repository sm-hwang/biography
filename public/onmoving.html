<p>I've always loved this <a href="https://imgur.com/F5KyVyD">artwork</a>. I found it as a 
background image of 
a video of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrqyYaFNlZ8">original composition</a> 
around six years ago. Although I was a 
fan of the musician's work, I loved the artwork more than the composition, even 
on first watch.</p>
<p>What I love are the dualities present. The cityscape
in the backdrop of a dark room to me seems like the unknown, the external, something
currently out of reach. Two opposite flavours are presented: the orange hued city
skyline fills me with a sense of wonder and curiosity, congruent  with
the boy looking outwards, while the blue tinted city is cold and 
unwelcoming, the fear of the unknown. The pitch
black darkness of the room can be isolating and gloomy, but to me its soothing:
the light from the city shines so much brighter, accentuating what the unknown can 
offer.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the artwork while strolling through my neighbourhood 
tonight. The neighbourhood is slightly elevated, and I could see the 
outline of the city in its orange glow.</p>
<p>I've lived in this neighbourhood for fourteen years, and I'm about to 
move on. Packing my things enveloped me with
old memories and nostalgia; I'm reminded
that this is the start of a new journey, but also an end to my life here. I'll miss 
this place; I won't forget my youth here.</p>
<p>What awaits me at my new destination? Will I approach it with a fear
of the unknown, or with wondrous new curiosity?</p>
