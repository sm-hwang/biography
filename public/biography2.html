<p>When I originally created <a href="biography.html">biography</a>, I wanted to write everything from scratch. I thought having no dependencies made my website even more personal and meaningful.</p>
<p>Now, I want to put as little time as possible maintaining this website, and reduce friction on writing and publishing. Thus, I'm <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">embracing boring technology</a> (at least for my website).</p>
<p>Biography now converts markdown files to html, and no longer supports my own custom Runic format. Additionally, I've dropped an implicit constraint I placed on myself of not using any Javascript; The website now load MathJax to support rendering math expressions.</p>
