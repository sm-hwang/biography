<p><a href="https://asone.ai">Asone</a> is a startup I joined as a co-founded. Innovation is usually the result of small, cumulative contributions by various people, rather than a  giant leap by any single individual; smaller cubes forming larger ones. This insight was an inspiration  for AsOne, a platform for massively collaborative research where anyone can contribute ideas regardless of  academic background.</p>
