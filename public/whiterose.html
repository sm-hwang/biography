<blockquote><p>You hack people, I hack time.</p></blockquote>
<p>This image was supposed to be the logo for a time tracking application I had in mind. I never ended up starting the project for one reason or another, but liked the logo enough that I've adopted it for personal use.</p>
<p>Since creating the logo, I've realized that my passion for technology is to enable people to reach their full potential, to aid in the crusade against  <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/">Resistance</a>. I've also been inspired by the likes of  <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html">Devine</a> and  <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/">others</a> to create my own tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Whiterose-the-Garden">Whiterose, the Garden</a> will  be an ecosystem of keyboard driven, minimalistic productivity tools (see <a href="https://github.com/Whiterose-the-Garden/tally-electron">Tally</a> for an example). I will design the tools primarily for my own use, but I have full confidence that others will find it  useful as well.</p>
