<p><a href="https://github.com/sm-hwang/hachi">Hachi</a> is a research project I did through the
PURE Award in my second year. Having a background in both biology and computer 
science, I was interested in the feasibility of storing digital data in DNA. Using 
(at the time) a novel encoding algorithm called the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaj2038#:~:text=DNA%20has%20the%20potential%20to,for%20information%20stored%20per%20nucleotide.">DNA Fountain algorithm</a>, I simulated the process of 
encoding data using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachimoji_DNA">Hachimoji DNA</a>,
which appends four additional synthetic nucleotides to the genetic alphabet.</p>
<p>The program simulates the molecular processes of storing and reading the 
digital data in DNA by using the reported error rates of these processes in 
literature. The goal was to determine whether DNA Fountain could still decode
the data even with higher error rates associated with synthetic nucleotides.</p>
<p>This project was a failure in terms of generating useful insights about DNA digital
storage, but was a healthy learning experience which paved the way for future 
research endeavours.</p>
