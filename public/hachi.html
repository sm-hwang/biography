<a href="https://github.com/sm-hwang/hachi">Hachi</a>
 is a research project I did through the 
<a href="https://taylorinstitute.ucalgary.ca/pure-awards">PURE Award</a>
 in my second year. Having a background in both biology and computer science, I was interested in the feasibility of storing digital data in DNA. Using (at the time) a novel encoding algorithm called the 
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaj2038#:~:text=DNA%20has%20the%20potential%20to,for%20information%20stored%20per%20nucleotide.">DNA Fountain Algorithm</a>
, I simulated the process of encoding data using 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachimoji_DNA">Hachimoji DNA</a>
, which appends four additional synthetic nucleotides to the genetic alphabet.
</p>

<p>
    The program simulates the molecular processes of storing and reading the digital data in  DNA by using the reported error rates of these processes in literature. The goal was to determine whether DNA Fountain could still decode the data even with the higher error rates associated with synthetic nucleotides.

<p>
    This project was a failure in terms of generating useful insight about DNA digital data storage,  but was a healthy learning experience which paved the way for future research endeavours.
