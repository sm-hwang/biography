<a href="https://github.com/Whiterose-the-Garden/tally-electron">Tally</a>
 is a minimalistic, keyboard driven habit tracker made using 
<a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">electron</a>
 and 
<a href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>
.
</p>

<p>
    Tally is modal like vim. The list of habits in <code>view</code> mode can be traversed by <code>j</code>/<code>k</code> for up/down.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>command</code> mode can be accessed by <code>:</code>. Use <code>esc</code> to exit back to <code>view</code> mode.
</p>

<p>
    New habits are added by
</p>

<pre><code>:add [HABIT NAME]</code></pre>

<p>
    and deleted by <code>dd</code> while hovering the habit to be deleted.
</p>

<p>
    The project has been abanoned since I no longer have a use for habit  trackers, and the memory required by elecron (> 100mb!) for such a small project was outrageous.
